    <h1>The coolest creature: The Pygmy Marmoset</h1>
    <p>The <em> pygmy marmoset </em> is awesome because <br>
       <strong>it is the world's smallest monkey! It weighs as much as a stick of butter, and it's tail is bigger than its body. They are very agile and are able to hide from tree to tree, out of sight of predators. Tree sap is their favorite food, which they get from climbing trees.They live in extended families called troops with usually five monkeys. They communicate to eachother through squeaks and high pitched noises not even humans can hear. </strong>.</p>
